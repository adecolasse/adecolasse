## <i class="fa-solid fa-user"></i> About me
Following a Master's degree in computer science, I now have 15 years of experience as a software engineer.I worked in companies of various sizes and domains, in France and in the United States. 

After being a full-stack developer for about 10 years, working mostly on back-end side, I progressively grew into leadership roles, first on technical side, then as people manager. I eventually reached a Senior Engineering Manager level at Expedia Group.

I oversaw teams up to ten people, mostly developers but also project and product managers, organized in agile teams relying on devOps workflows and tools.
