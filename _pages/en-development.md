## <i class="fa-solid fa-user"></i> About me
A Master’s degree graduate in computer science, I now have 15 years of experience as software engineer. I worked in companies of various sizes and domains, in France and in the United States.

I mostly developed in Java environments on the back-end side, but I also have some experiences on the front-end using JS frameworks. On top of my full-stack skills, I made extensive usage of Agile and DevOps concepts during my different assignments.

Recently, I've been promoted to leaderships roles (tech lead, manager) inside development teams, where I organized the way of working and made important architectural and technical decisions.

### TAAP, Expedia Group
*Paris - 2023*

During my last year at Traveldoo (Expedia Group), I contributed on two [Expedia TAAP](https://www.expediataap.com/) projects to compensate for the decreasing activity. I worked first on `REST` and `GraphQL APIs` inside an AWS environment, and then on the `NodeJS/React` front-end applications used by all Expedia's sites.

I collaborated with Expedia teams, as would have done a freelance developer, facing a new and complex technical context that I had to demystify before I could make significant contributions.
